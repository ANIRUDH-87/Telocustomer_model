# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

# Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to churn based on demographic details, account information, and service usage data.

The project is implemented end-to-end using Python in Google Colab, covering data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn and helps telecom companies take proactive retention actions.


## Dataset Information
- Dataset: Telco Customer Churn  
- Source: Kaggle  
- Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)  
- Features include:
  - Customer demographics
  - Contract and tenure information
  - Billing and payment details
  - Service usage attributes

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  


## Project Workflow
The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline:

1. Problem understanding  
2. Data loading and inspection  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
5. Feature engineering  
6. Model building  
7. Model evaluation  

## Machine Learning Models
Supervised machine learning models were trained to classify churn and non-churn customers.  
The primary focus of this project is model evaluation and performance analysis.

Detailed implementation is available inside the notebook.


## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy score  
- Confusion matrix  
- ROC-AUC score  

These metrics were used to measure the effectiveness of the churn prediction model.


## Results and Conclusion
- The model successfully identifies customers who are likely to churn.
- Exploratory analysis shows strong relationships between churn and factors such as contract type, monthly charges, and payment method.
- The solution can help businesses design targeted customer retention strategies.
